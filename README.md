# bullgit-badges
You're a Gitch ? And you want to let the world know about it ? 

### How to ? 
You have to download [the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bullgit/bullgit-badges/master/bullgit-badges.min.js) and add a `<script src="path/to/bullgit-badges.min.js"></script>`. 

You'll see a bottom corner with the bullgit logo inside, appear on your page, and by clicking it, it'll redirect you to the [bullgit website](http://bullg.it)

### How it'll looks ? 

Like this  :

### What's inside ? 
Well, not much per say. It's vanilla javascript, that append a style tag within css rules to your document, and the only request made by the script, is to grab the bullgit logo.
